        <p><strong>Software Description</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>EAM is a third-party tool for <strong>Realm of the Mad God (RotMG)</strong>,
                offering multi-account management, credential storage, and additional features
                (&ldquo;EAM Plus&rdquo;).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Not affiliated with Deca Games</strong> (the developer of RotMG).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Where to Find These Terms</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hosted on EAM&rsquo;s dedicated website, accessible via the
                &ldquo;View Terms of Service&rdquo; button in EAM&rsquo;s Settings.</li>
            <li>We do not store a personal copy of your contract. You can always view
                the current version online.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Contract Language</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Terms are provided only in English. By using EAM, you acknowledge
                and accept the English version as binding.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>2. Formation of Contract</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Offer &amp; Acceptance</strong><br />
                When you click &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; on the Stripe Checkout page, you make
                a <em>binding offer</em> to subscribe to EAM Plus. The contract is formed once
                your payment is successfully processed by Stripe and we
                <strong>provide you with access</strong> to EAM Plus features.
            </li>
            <li><strong>No Individual Storage of Contract</strong><br />
                We do not store a unique contract text for each user. The latest version of
                these Terms is always accessible on our website for reference.
            </li>
            <li><strong>VAT &amp; Currency</strong><br />
                All subscription fees <strong>include VAT</strong> (if applicable under German/EU law)
                and are charged in <strong>EUR (&euro;)</strong>. If you pay in another currency,
                your bank or credit card provider handles any currency conversion.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Invoices</strong><br />
                After a successful purchase, an <strong>invoice</strong> is generated by Stripe.
                You can access and download it via the
                <em>Manage Subscription</em> page (linked from EAM&rsquo;s Profile Page).

                Portions of EAM are open-source, subject to their respective licenses. However,
                <strong>EAM Plus</strong> is <strong>proprietary</strong> and closed-source.
            </li>
            <li><strong>License Grant</strong><br />
                We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use
                EAM, subject to these Terms.

            <li><strong>Use of Name &amp; Logo</strong><br />
                You may reference EAM (e.g., in tutorials or discussions) but must not impersonate
                EAM, pass yourself off as an official representative, or sell EAM/parts of it without permission.

                EAM runs on <strong>Windows 10 or later</strong>. Basic features do not require

            <li><strong>No Minimum Age</strong><br />
                We do not impose a specific age restriction, but Discord&rsquo;s Terms
                commonly require users to be <strong>13+</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bans &amp; Suspensions</strong><br />
                We may suspend or ban your EAM (Auth0) account for violating these Terms.

                of these external services.
