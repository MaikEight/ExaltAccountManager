        <h2>2. Data We Collect &amp; Purposes</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
        <p>Under the GDPR, we process your personal data based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contractual Necessity (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong>: For providing authentication via Auth0,
                managing subscriptions
                via Stripe, and syncing settings if you opt in.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong>: For security, fraud prevention, and certain
                limited analytics
                (where not consent-based).</li>
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong>: Where you explicitly opt in to analytics, and you may
                withdraw this consent
                at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Types of Data Collected</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Discord ID &amp; Auth0 User ID</strong><br />
                <em>Purpose</em>: Authentication for advanced EAM features (e.g., subscription management, settings
                sync).<br />
                <em>Storage</em>: Held in your Auth0 &ldquo;app_metadata&rdquo; and used only to identify your account.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stripe Customer ID (for paid users)</strong><br />
                <em>Purpose</em>: Subscription management and payment handling.<br />
                <em>Storage</em>: Stored in Auth0 metadata and on our backend to link your EAM subscription status.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Optional User Settings</strong><br />
                <em>Purpose</em>: If you enable settings sync, these preferences (e.g., UI preferences) are stored
                in Auth0 metadata.<br />
                <em>Control</em>: You can disable or delete synced settings anytime.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics Data</strong><br />
                <em>Purpose</em>: To improve EAM by understanding usage patterns, app performance, and feature
                adoption.<br />
                <em>How It Works</em>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Approx. Location</strong> (country, city) is derived server-side from your IP using an
                        IP-range lookup.
                        We do <strong>not</strong> store the IP itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hashed Client Hardware ID (HWID)</strong> is sent unless you choose the
                        &ldquo;Anonymized&rdquo; option.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymized</strong> or <strong>Opt-Out</strong> modes are available (see
                        &ldquo;Analytics &amp; Consent&rdquo; below).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Information</strong><br />
                Handled securely by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We never store credit card numbers or billing info.
                We only store a reference to your <strong>Stripe Customer ID</strong> and subscription details
                for account verification and subscription management.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.3 Analytics &amp; Consent Options</h3>
        <p>You can choose how much data to share via in-app settings:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Full Analytics</strong><br />
                Sends <em>hashed HWID</em> and approximate location (country, city). Helps us diagnose recurring issues
                per device and optimize the app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anonymized</strong><br />
                Replaces your hashed HWID with <code>ANONYMIZED</code>, but still stores approximate location. We cannot
                link data to a specific device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Opt-Out</strong><br />
                No analytics data is sent at all.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you withdraw consent for analytics, we stop collecting new data immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Logs (Client-Side Only)</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Error Logs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location</strong>: Stored locally in the app&rsquo;s interface (Logs section).</li>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: 90 days; older entries are deleted upon the next application start.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage</strong>: For troubleshooting by you or, if you choose, shared with us for support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Debug Logs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location</strong>: Stored in a local <code>log.txt</code> file on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: Overwritten with each app startup (only the latest session is kept).</li>
            <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Helpful for diagnosing difficult bugs; only accessible if you manually provide
                it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Audit Logs</h3>
        <ul>

                data was fetched).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Note</em>: We do not automatically receive any logs. They remain on your device, and you may share them
            with us at your discretion (e.g., for troubleshooting).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Auth0 &amp; Stripe Metadata</strong>: Retained as long as you have an active account or
                subscription.
                Deleted upon account closure, unless necessary for tax or legal obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anonymized Analytics</strong>: Stored indefinitely, as it is non-identifiable. If you opt out or
                withdraw consent, no further analytics are collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Records</strong>: We rely on <strong>Stripe</strong> to handle payments and comply with
                tax laws
                (potentially up to 10 years in Germany, e.g., under local tax code). We cannot erase financial
                transaction data
                required by law.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User-Initiated Deletion</strong>:

                    </li>
                    <li><em>Immediate Action</em>: We delete requested data promptly, unless retained for legal or
                        contractual reasons.</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Where Data Is Stored &amp; Transferred</h2>

            We store data on <strong>self-hosted servers</strong> in Germany (NetCup &amp; Hetzner).<br />

        <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption in Transit</strong>: We use SSL/TLS (HTTPS) to secure data sent over the internet.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Local Encryption</strong>: Sensitive data (e.g., Auth0 refresh tokens) is encrypted on your
                device
                with Windows Data Protection API.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Server-Side Data</strong>: We do not store raw IP addresses, only approximate location

                an IP lookup.</li>
            <li><strong>No Automated Decision-Making</strong>: We do not use automated profiling that produces legal or

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>We do not explicitly restrict minors from using EAM. However, advanced features (e.g., subscription
            management,
            settings sync) require a <strong>Discord login</strong>, which is subject to
            <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Discord&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a> (minimum age
            typically 13+).
            By choosing to log in via Discord, you confirm you meet Discord&rsquo;s age requirements.
        </p>
        <p><em>Optional Note</em>: We do not knowingly allow children under 13 to create an authenticated user account.
            If we become
            aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data without parental consent, we will delete such
            data.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Policy Updates &amp; Notifications</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. Major changes
            will be
            communicated in-app or via a prominent notice. The latest version is always linked within EAM. Continued use
            of EAM
            after updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
