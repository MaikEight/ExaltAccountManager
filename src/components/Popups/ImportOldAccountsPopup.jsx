                This is a new version of the EAM application.
                It has been rewritten from scratch to improve performance, security and (soonâ„¢) to add new and exciting features.

                Sadly it is not compatible with the older versions, so you need to import your accounts to use them here.
                If you want to do that, you can use the button below to do that automatically.<br />
                Older versions of the EAM will still work and you can use it to access your accounts.

                If you don't want to import your old accounts, you can just close this popup and start using the application as if it was a new installation.
