                            EAM has been a free and open-source project since its first got released in 2020. However, maintaining and developing the application requires significant time and resources.

                            No, EAM will remain a free and open-source application. The introduction of EAM Plus is meant to provide additional features for those who wish to support the project financially.

                            Nothing. If no one subscribes to EAM Plus, the application will continue to function as it always has. The core features will remain available for free, and the project will continue to be maintained.
